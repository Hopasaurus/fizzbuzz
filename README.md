fizzbuzz playground

I was playing with fizz buzz at Code & Coffee this morning.

The original idea was to make a code generating program that would spew forth code in any of a selection of desired languages.  This somehow morphed into wanting to use the same "business logic" section of code as the code for both C and Perl.  It can be done, see the c_and_perl directory.  You might want to practice cringing before you peek at it, so you don't pull a cringe muscle when you see the actual code.

Later:

c_with_tests:
This was fiddling around with a very basic header only test "framework" this may be featured in an upcoming video.

c_gen:
This is a FizzBuzz generator, it includes a start of a test framework that compiles and runs the generator and also outputs TAP output. It would be fairly easy to spin up a CI server that could trigger off git commits and run these tests. Possibly the subject of some near future play time.

To run the tests, go into the c_gen directory and run `prove` this assumes you have all the perly things you need.
